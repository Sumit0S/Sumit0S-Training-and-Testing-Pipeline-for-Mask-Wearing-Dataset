# Sumit0S-Training-and-Testing-Pipeline-for-Mask-Wearing-Dataset
The goal is to train and test object detection models—YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN—on the Mask Wearing Dataset. This dataset contains labeled images of people with and without masks, enabling the models to detect whether individuals are wearing masks.
