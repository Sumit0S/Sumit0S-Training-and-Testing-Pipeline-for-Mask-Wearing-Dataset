# Sumit0S-Training-and-Testing-Pipeline-for-Mask-Wearing-Dataset
The goal is to train and test object detection models—YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN—on the Mask Wearing Dataset. This dataset contains labeled images of people with and without masks, enabling the models to detect whether individuals are wearing masks.


2. Dataset Preparation
3. Training the Models
YOLOv5 Training Steps:
• Use a pre-trained YOLOv5 model (e.g., YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m).
• Modify the configuration file to match the dataset classes (e.g., "with_mask",
"without_mask").
• Train the model using transfer learning on a GPU.
• Save the trained model weights.
Faster R-CNN Training Steps:
• Use a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model (e.g., based on ResNet-50).
• Fine-tune the model on the Mask Wearing dataset.
• Train for multiple epochs, monitoring loss and performance.
• Save the trained model.
4. Testing and Evaluation
✴ Run inference on test images.
✴ Measure performance using:
✴ Mean Average Precision (mAP)
✴ Precision and Recall
✴ Confusion Matrix
✴ Inference speed (YOLO vs. Faster R-CNN)
✴ Visualize results with bounding boxes overlaid on test images.



Feature Extraction from Stanford
Car Dataset
1. Objective
We aim to extract visual features from images of cars using different pre-trained CNN models
(ResNet-50, VGG-16, VGG-19, and InceptionNetV3). The extracted features will help in tasks like
classification, clustering, or retrieval.
2. Dataset Overview
• The Stanford Cars Dataset contains images of various car models.
• Each image has a label corresponding to the car's make and model.
3. Feature Extraction Process
Step 1: Load Pretrained CNN Models
• Use TensorFlow Keras models like ResNet-50, VGG-16, VGG-19, and InceptionNetV3.
• Load the weights trained on ImageNet.
Step 2: Select Three Layers for Feature Extraction
• Extract features from different layers (e.g., an early convolutional layer, an intermediate
layer, and a deep layer).
• Early layers capture basic textures, edges, and shapes.
• Deeper layers capture complex object-level features.
Step 3: Extract and Visualize Features
• Select 5 random images from the dataset.
• Pass each image through the network and extract features.
• Convert extracted features into a visual representation using a technique like Feature Maps
or Grad-CAM.
• Display the extracted features as images.
